# Dynamic Sliding Mode Control On A Second Degree System And Compared With Classic SMC

This project is a solution to homework 3 of my fault detection and control university course. The simulation of this project was done with simulink in the SlidingMode_HW3_DynamicSMC.slx and SlidingMode_HW3_ClassicSMC.slx files. Also, the report (in persian) for this project is in the Fault-SMC-HW3-DSMC Report.pdf file that expresses the problem and the solution completely.

This project is about implementing the dynamic sliding mode method for controlling a second degree nonlinear system stated in the report that has one uncertain parameter. The first chapter is about designing the sliding mode controller and its parameters for both dynamic and classic SMC. And finally, the second chapter is devoted to simulation and its results and comparing DSMC with CSMC. The results show that the dynamic SMC has less chattering in the control input at the cost of increasing the steady-state error.
